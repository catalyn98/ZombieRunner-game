# Tech stack
Zombie Runner uses a number of open source projects to work properly:
* [Unity](https://unity.com) - is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X game engine.
* [C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/tour-of-csharp/) - is a modern, object-oriented, and type-safe programming language and enables developers to build many types of secure and robust applications that run in .NET.

# Installation
To run a program in Unity, you need the following elements installed on your computer:
- Unity Hub - is a launcher that facilitates the management and installation of different versions of Unity. You can download Unity Hub for free from the official Unity website and use it to install and manage the Unity versions you need.
- Unity Version - After installing Unity Hub, you need to select and install a specific version of the Unity engine. Unity offers multiple versions, each with different features and updates. Make sure you select and install the appropriate version for your project. The current application was created using Unity Version 2020.2.7f1.

### Clone the repositories

# Credit
This game was created based on a Unity tutorial from Udemy titled **"Complete C# Unity Game Developer 3D"**. You can find the tutorial [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/unitycourse2/).

### Description
The tutorial provided a comprehensive guide on developing a game using Unity, covering essential concepts such as game mechanics, player controls, and level design. It served as a valuable resource for learning the fundamentals of game development and provided inspiration for the creation of this game.
Throughout the tutorial, I gained a good understanding of Unity's features, including scene management, asset integration, and scripting in C#. The step-by-step instructions and hands-on exercises helped me grasp key concepts and apply them in a practical way.

### Acknowledgment
I would like to express my gratitude to Rick for creating such an informative and engaging tutorial. Their expertise and clear explanations greatly facilitated the development process of this game. I highly recommend checking out the tutorial for anyone interested in learning Unity game development.
